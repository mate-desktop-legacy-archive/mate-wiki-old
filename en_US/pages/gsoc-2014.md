# Google Summer of Code 2014

## Instructions

Use the Google Summer of Code [Wiki](http://code.google.com/p/google-summer-of-code/) and
[FAQs](http://www.google-melange.com/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2013/help_page) for
information about the project.

### Programming languages

Most MATE applications are written in C. We have also few applications and
applets written in Python. Almost all applications have Python bindings
generated with [GObject introspection](https://live.gnome.org/GObjectIntrospection).

### Getting started

Read the [Contribute](./contribute) page to learn how to get
started with MATE Desktop development.

### Contact MATE developers

If you have questions or suggestions, you could contact MATE developers
through IRC or our mailing list.

**IRC :** Join #mate channel on irc.freenode.net.

**Mailing list:** MATE development mailing list web interface is located at
<http://ml.mate-desktop.org/listinfo/mate-dev>.

## Ideas

apply for.

**Mentors:**

  * Stefano Karapetsas (stefano-k on irc)

  * Martin Wimpress (flexiondotorg on irc)

### ePub format support in Atril

**Brief explanation:** Atril is the MATE document viewer and already has
support for a variety of document formats: PostScript (PS), Encapsulated
PostScript (EPS), DJVU, DVI, Portable Document Format ( PDF) and Open XML
Paper Specification (XPS). We would like to add support to open also
[EPUB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB)
files. EPUB is a short for “electronic publication”, it is a free and open
e-book standard by the International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF).

**Knowledge prerequisite:** C.

**Difficulty level:** Medium.

### GStreamer-1.0 support

**Brief explanation:** [GStreamer](http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/) is a multimedia framework. MATE currently
supports GStreamer 0.10, but this version now is no longer maintained.
GStreamer 1.0 includes a lot of improvements and new features, but it is not
API or ABI compatible with the 0.10. We would like to add support for this new
version of GStreamer.

**Knowledge prerequisites:** C (GStreamer framework a plus).

**Difficulty level:** Medium.

### Plugin system in Caja

**Brief explanation:** Caja, our file manager, has a nice library to allow
developers to create extensions. But these extensions are loaded during Caja
start, and there is no possibility to enable/disable them at runtime. Add a
way to enable and disable Caja extensions is one of the goals of MATE Desktop
roadmap.

**Knowledge prerequisite:** C (GLib and GTK a plus).

**Difficulty level:** Medium.
