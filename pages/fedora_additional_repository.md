# Fedora MATE additional repository

This repository is maintained by Wolfgang Ulbrich, fedora MATE maintainer,

## Fedora 21

Additional Mate repo which includes community packages and packages which
aren't available in fedora repos.

A full package list you will find here https://forums.mate-desktop.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=2957

    
    
    yum install https://dl.dropbox.com/u/105479527/Mate-Desktop/fedora-release-extra-21/mate-desktop-fedora/noarch/mate-desktop-extra-release-21-1.fc21.noarch.rpm

You can install the packages via yum. I also add a group install information
which installs all packages except mate-mplayer (rpmfusion needed)

    
    
    yum groupinstall mate-desktop-extra
