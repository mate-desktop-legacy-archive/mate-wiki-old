to Yum, you can install MATE with the following command:


    yum groupinstall mate-desktop

If you install this on a minimal system without an existing GUI configured
(such as a GNOME or KDE desktop), you might want to install the X Window

you may also want to change the default systemd target to graphical:


    systemctl set-default graphical.target

## Gentoo

MATE Desktop or install _task-mate-minimal_ for minimal MATE Desktop
installation. You can also install MATE Desktop from command-line: `urpmi
task-mate`

Due to dependencies of some other applications to deprecated MATE packages,
MATE 1.8 will not be provided as an update or backport to avoid possible
crashes/problems. However, there is an unsupported, unofficial repository
providing MATE 1.8 version. Please read [below section](./download#mageia_3.md)
and use same commands to add the repository.

  * Add unofficial repositories from commandline as _root_ :

    
    
     urpmi.addmedia --distrib 'https://tarakbumba.mageia.org.pl/$RELEASE/$ARCH'

  * Use the code **exactly** seen as above. See about [ this post](https://forums.mageia.org/en/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=4867&start=125#p46058) for urpmi variables

  * Then install either _task-mate-minimal_ for a minimal installation or _task-mate_ for full MATE Desktop via rpmdrake or urpmi.
