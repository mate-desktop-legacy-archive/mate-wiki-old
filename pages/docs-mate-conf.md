# Configuration system (mate-conf)

MateConf is a system that was invented to make application preferences more
manageable for system administrators.

MateConf stores data in the user space in $HOME/.mateconf:

  * desktop/mate for desktop settings

  * apps 

## MateConf tool

mateconftool-2 is the MATE configuration tool. It is meant to be used from
command line

    
    
    $ mateconftool-2 -R /desktop/mate

That will display some of the MATE desktop settings.

## MateConf editor

The MateConf Editor is a graphical application and as such is more targeted
towards the general user.
