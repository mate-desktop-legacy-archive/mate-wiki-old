# Introduction to MATE

## What is MATE?

MATE is a fork of the now unmaintained [GNOME 2](https://www.gnome.org).
MATE provides an intuitive and attractive desktop environment using traditional metaphors for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems.

MATE is under active development to add support for new technologies while preserving a traditional desktop experience. MATE also supports running the environment without compositing, making MATE a suitable choice for lower-end hardware.

## MATE Applications

MATE largely consists of GNOME 2 applications, utilities and applets, which have been forked and renamed to avoid conflicts with their GNOME 3 counterparts.

  * Alacarte is renamed Mozo;

  * Nautilus is renamed Caja;

  * Metacity is renamed Marco;

  * Gedit is renamed Pluma;

  * Eye of GNOME is renamed Eye of MATE;

  * Evince is renamed Atril;

  * File Roller is renamed Engrampa.

## Where does the name come from?

The name “MATE” comes from [yerba maté](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerba_mate), a species of holly native to subtropical South America. Its leaves contain caffeine and are used to make infusions and a beverage called mate. The name is pronounced like “Mah-tay”, not like “Mait”.
