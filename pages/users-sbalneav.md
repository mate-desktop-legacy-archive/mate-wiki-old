# Scott Balneaves (sbalneav)

I'm a Systems Administrator at Legal Aid Manitoba, and a developer of
[LTSP](https://ltsp.org). I've been a Unix user since 1985,
and purchased my first copy of [Yggdrasil
LGX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yggdrasil_Linux/GNU/X) in 1993. Yes, I still
have the disk. Yes, I also still have the installation manual.

I wouldn't consider myself to be particularly good at graphics stuff, since I
mainly do “systems” type programming (PAM modules, etc.), but I know my way
around a C compiler, and can do some packaging stuff for Debian/Ubuntu. I'm
interested in [MATE](https://mate-desktop.org)
because my users at work are used to the “unattractive and hard-to-use” Gnome2
desktop, and I want to try to provide them with what they're used to.
